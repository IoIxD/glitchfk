# Glitchfuck

This is the repository for a program and server that generates gradients and noise and xor's them together. Unlike [IoIxD/glitchfuckOld](https://github.com/IoIxD/glitchfuckOld/), this is a more complete CLI program that contains code for a server that autoamtically posts these to Twitter, as well as a Discord bot that lets you generate them via slash commands.
