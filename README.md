# Glitchfuck

This is the repository for code that generates random gradients and noise and xor's them together. Unlike [IoIxD/glitchfuckOld](https://github.com/IoIxD/glitchfuckOld/), this is a more complete ~~CLI~~ program ~~that contains code for a server that autoamtically posts these to Twitter, as well as a Discord bot that lets you generate them via slash commands.~~ Currently finishing up a rewrite, these will be added in due time.
